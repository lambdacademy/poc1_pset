<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
  In this project you're going to make a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>
  clone that we call <strong>Lambda News</strong>.
  We're going to start off <em>very simple</em> but we'll make it fancier over time.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  If you're completely new to programming: <strong>go you!</strong>
  We'll do everything we can to help you learn, but you might want
  to <a href="javascript:alert('todo')">check out some intro resources</a> first. This lesson is geared
  towards someone who has a little background.
</p>

<h3>Lets get this party started!</h3>

<p>
Before we begin writing code we should make sure the build is healthy. To do that, start up your
<code>rails server</code>! If it works, you should be able to see your server at
<a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="localhost">http://localhost:3000/</a>.
